# Welcome to Smart Contracts with Solidity 🙋‍♂️
### Description
So in blockchain smart contract is like a legal contract and all the transections are performed accordingly based on the instructions written in the document.
This is the combination of multiple functions. A few on then are standard and some are not but **basic purpose of them is to interact your web app with blockchain.**

### Language
For EVM based blockchains 🔗 we write the smart contracts 📄 in **Solidity**, it is a very popular language for writing smart contracts for EVM based chains.
It is very simple, lightweight and also based on OOP(Object Oriented Programming)

### Truffle

Truffle is a world-class development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), aiming to make life as a developer easier.
